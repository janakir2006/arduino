            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>In this project, we are going to design a Fingerprint Sensor
             Based Biometric Attendance System using Arduino. Simply we will
            be interfacing fingerprint sensor with Arduino, LCD Display &
            RTC Module to design the desired project. In this project, we
            used the fingerprint Module and Arduino to take and keep 
            attendance data and records.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>The project focuses on developing a Fingerprint Biometric 
            Attendance System using Arduino technology. Biometric systems
            have gained prominence in various sectors due to their ability
            to provide secure and efficient identification methods. 
            In educational institutions and workplaces, traditional
            attendance methods often face challenges such as buddy 
            punching and inaccurate record-keeping. The integration of 
            biometric technology, specifically fingerprint recognition, 
            offers a reliable solution to these issues, ensuring that 
            attendance is recorded accurately and securely.</p>

        <div class="para3">
            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>The primary problem addressed by this project is the inefficiency
            and inaccuracies associated with conventional attendance systems.
            Manual roll calls and sign-in sheets are time-consuming and can
            easily be manipulated, leading to discrepancies in attendance 
            records. The implementation of a biometric system aims to 
            eliminate these issues by ensuring that only authorized individuals 
            can mark their attendance, thus improving the integrity of attendance
            data.</p>

        <div class="p4">
            <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <p>The main objectives of the Fingerprint Biometric Attendance System project are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To design and implement a reliable biometric attendance system 
                using Arduino</li>
            <li>To ensure accurate and tamper-proof attendance records. </li>
            <li>To develop a user-friendly interface for both administrators and users.</li>
            <li>To evaluate the system's performance in real-world scenarios.</li>
        </ol>

            <h3>Significance</h3>
        <p>This project addresses the need for efficient attendance management 
            using biometric technology. It enhances accuracy, saves time, and 
            improves accountability, making it valuable for institutions and 
            organizations.</p>
